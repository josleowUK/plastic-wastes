## Critique One

[https://chels-map.github.io/ky_photoperiod_2021](https://chels-map.github.io/ky_photoperiod_2021)
Colors vary from month when slide from Jan to Dec.
However color is a bit monotone in certain months.
The legend is too long but It seems to indicate something on map. I am not sure what Photoperiod is. It would be nice if there is short description so we know what it is about.
Also the whole map should have its sown color variation. For example, the Jan shows yellow, I am not sure if its data is only limited for certain ranges?
There are no data sources or author information.

Suggestion:
It would be better if the map is enlarged on full view instead of 2 white space gaps at top and bottom. Also make the map with legend mobile responsive.

## Critique Two

Interesting that it show the path - it feels like train journey if I am not wrong.

There are no title and description. The url mentions the end segment: "NYC Subway" but users will not know what the map is actually about or what it is for. There are no data sources or author information.

The page is not mobile responsive. Title says "USA by County but the map does not show clearly what county it is. Also, the map is squeezed in the svg tag so the map is smaller than intended.
When select the start and end, it maps the journey and the font size is too large and it forces user to scroll down to the end of journey. The dropdown inputs do not refresh.

Suggestion:
Make the map large enough to cover the map div. Make the stops in the smaller font so we do not have to scroll down to the end of journey. Should clear the dropdown options automatically and then re-map the path and journey. The circles on the different color lines should show the popup where it is.

## Critique Three

The map is a good work. Nothing I can say more except that it is not mobile friendly and swiping colors do not change.

Suggestion:
Swiping to dark side for example, the colors on map should also change according to the light or dark side. If it is light, map colors revert.
