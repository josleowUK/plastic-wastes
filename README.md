The processing tool is MapShaper to convert csv to geojson and topojson. The data on plastic waste is in CSV and map is in geojson. The map is currently created with D3.js. The template is reused from previous assignments - Bootstrap. 

## Data sources

The data sources are from the World bank website and Natural Earth.

## Conclusion or Insight

I feel that data source from World Bank may not be sufficient because it is a bit hard to map the data for legend or color scheme.
